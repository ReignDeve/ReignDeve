# Hey, I’m Marius 👋

I’m a **final-year Bachelor’s student in Media Informatics** and **working student / intern at adesso SE**, based in Germany 🇩🇪.  
I build **clean, scalable web applications** and enjoy turning complex requirements into practical, maintainable solutions.

I’m especially interested in **full-stack development, cloud-native systems, and AI-powered applications**.
I value **readable code, clear communication, and long-term maintainability**.

I mainly work with **React, Next.js, and TypeScript** on the frontend and **.NET 8 with Azure** on the backend, including cloud services, CI/CD pipelines, and AI integrations using **OpenAI APIs and Microsoft Semantic Kernel**.

Fun Facts:

- I've been skiing since I was two years old

- Hobbies: music, skiing, climbing, singing
