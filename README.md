# Hey, I’m Marius 👋

I’m a **final-year Bachelor’s student in Media Informatics** and **working student / intern at adesso SE**, based in Germany 🇩🇪.  
I build **clean, scalable web applications** and enjoy turning complex requirements into practical, maintainable solutions.

I’m especially interested in **full-stack development, cloud-native systems, and AI-powered applications**.

## 👨‍💻 What I do

- Full-stack development with a strong front-end focus  
- Designing clean architectures and CI/CD pipelines  
- Building AI-assisted systems that support users instead of replacing thinking  
- Working in international, agile teams with a calm and structured approach  

I value **readable code, clear communication, and long-term maintainability**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

I mainly work with **React, Next.js, and TypeScript** on the frontend and **.NET 8 with Azure** on the backend, including cloud services, CI/CD pipelines, and AI integrations using **OpenAI APIs and Microsoft Semantic Kernel**.
